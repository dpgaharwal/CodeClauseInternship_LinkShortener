# CodeClauseInternship_LinkShortener
Link Shortener Project:

The Link Shortener Project is a simple yet powerful web application built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its primary purpose is to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links, facilitating easy sharing across various platforms.

**Overview:**

The link shortener serves as a valuable tool for users looking to condense lengthy URLs into compact forms, particularly useful in scenarios where character space is limited, such as social media posts or text messages.

**Features:**

1. **Shorten Links:** Users can input lengthy URLs and generate concise, unique links for sharing purposes.

2. **Custom URLs:** Optionally, users have the flexibility to customize the shortened URL slug, enhancing ease of recall and personalization.

3. **Redirects:** Shortened links seamlessly redirect users to the original long URL, ensuring a smooth browsing experience.

4. **Analytics:** Basic analytics functionality is provided, enabling users to track the number of times a shortened link has been accessed.

**Technologies Used:**

1. **Node.js:** Leveraged as the JavaScript runtime for server-side development, enabling efficient handling of backend operations.

2. **Express:** Utilized as the web framework for building the application's backend, simplifying route handling and middleware management.

3. **MongoDB:** Employed as a NoSQL database for storing link mappings and analytics data, offering scalability and flexibility.

4. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend technologies utilized for crafting the user interface and implementing interactive features.

**Setup:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or adjust the database configuration as necessary.
4. Start the server using `node index.js` or `npm start`.
5. Access the application through your preferred web browser.

**Configuration:**

Database connection details and other settings can be configured in the `index.js` file. Port configuration and additional settings can also be adjusted within the same file.

**Usage:**

1. Visit the homepage of the application in your web browser.
2. Enter a long URL into the provided input field.
3. Optionally, customize the slug for the shortened URL.
4. Click the "Shorten" button to generate the shortened link.
5. Copy the generated short link and share it as needed.
